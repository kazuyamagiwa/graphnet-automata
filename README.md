# graphnet-automata
"graphnet-automata" is a study of the evolution of graphs using cellular automaton-like methods, written in Python.  This study was inspired by the recent announcement from Wolfram concerning his work on graph automata.
 
# DEMO
 
You can learn how to making cute physics simulations (looks retro game).

This animation is a "Cat playing on trampoline"!
You can get basic skills for making physics simulations.
 
# Features
 
graphnet-automata uses [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) and Numpy.
```python
import networkx
import numpy
```
# Requirement
 
* Python 3.x
* NetworkX 
 
graphnet-automata has been tested under [Anaconda for Windows](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).
 
```bash
conda create -n pyxel pip python=3.6 Anaconda
activate pyxel
```
 
# Installation
 
Install Pyxel with pip command.
 
```bash
pip install pyxel
```
 
# Usage
 
Please create python code named "demo.py".
And copy &amp; paste [Day4 tutorial code](https://cpp-learning.com/pyxel_physical_sim4/).
 
Run "demo.py"
 
```bash
python demo.py
```
 
# Note
 
I don't test environments under Linux and Mac.
